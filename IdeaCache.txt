OBJECTIVES
------------
1) Randomized Maps
2) New Monsters/Adventurers
3) Traps/Treasure
4) Improved GUI
5) Networking

ADVENTURERS
------------
Thieves, with higher move and vision
Class that can resurrect at spawn (themselves? fellow adventurers? idk)
Ranged Attack
HP Regen and/or Targeted heal

MONSTERS
------------
 - Imp: 1 HP, Baleful Teleport, (high movement?)
 		Alternate: Teleport assailent when attacked?
 - Knight: moves like a chess knight

ABILITIES
------------
 - Baleful Teleport: forcibly teleports target to a random valid location on the map
 - Wall Placement: Places a wall tile on an empty space/maybe displaces and damages another tile
 		Note: If it extends beyond layer 2, this could mess up objectives, spawn, treasure, doors, etc
 - Passive resets on kill or something like that

ITEMS
------------
- *Slayer: Additional damage/instant kill against certain enemy types (random generation?)

OTHER
------------
 - Instead of a create button, have a button that marks all viable tiles. Other buttons on a marked tile will spawn instead.
 - Change spawn's name to Enter, or something else that sounds less like a monster thing
 - Keep and display a log of actions, not sure how to display during transition
 - Adjust a* to account for different types of adjacency, allowing different movement patterns
 - "Undo" button for mistaken actions?
 
 TO DO
 ------------
 - Separate move and attack commands, preferably with a more intuitive interface
 - Displayed movement, attack, and vision ranges
 - Improved vision (no seeing through doors/around corners/etc.)
 - Loading screen before map gen
 
 COMPLETED
 ------------
 - Screen between turns to avoid hotseat screenpeeking - Check
 - Walls blocking line of sight - Check
 - Continual vision at spawn - Check
 - Information about selected tile - Check
 - Pause between end of turn and blackscreen (require user acknowledgment) - Check
